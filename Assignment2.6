4.Write a program to accepts two numbers from stdin and find all the odd as well as even
numbers present in between them.



package Code;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class acad {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a,b,i=0;
		Scanner in=new Scanner(System.in);
		a=in.nextInt();
		b=in.nextInt();
		for(i=a+1;i<b;i++)
		{
			if(i%2==0)
				System.out.println("Even "+i);
			else
				System.out.println("Odd "+i);
		}
	
	}
}




5.Joe is scared to go to school. When her dad asked the reason, Joe said she is unable to complete
the task given by her teacher. The task was to find the “first 10 multiples” of the number entered
from stdin. 

package Code;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class acad {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a;
		Scanner in=new Scanner(System.in);
		a=in.nextInt();
		for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)
		{
			System.out.println(a+"x"+i+"="+(a*i));
		}

	}
}



6.Write a program consisting method sum() and demonstrate the concept of method
overloading using this method.



acad.java

package Code;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class acad {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		S1 s=new S1();
		s.sum(1,2);
		s.sum(1.1,2.2);  
	}
}



S1.java

package Code;

public class S1
{
public void sum(int a,int b)
{
	System.out.println("Int Sum is:"+(a+b));
}

public void sum(double a,double b)
{
	System.out.println("Double Sum is:"+(a+b));
}
}
